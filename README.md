* Map the labels like Negative, Positive, Unknown_state, Mixed_feelings, not-malayala/tamil to 0,1,2,3,4 repectively.
* Clean the data(not implemented yet)
* Convert the data into features using [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)
* Then these features are trained using [Multinomial NaiveBayes model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html) for from SKLEARN Module.
* From trained set we find the sentiment analysis of test data.
* We get values like 0,1,2,3,4 which will be mapped to original labels.
* Results can be found in result-tam.csv or result-mal.csv
